# Subqueries

- A Subquery is a nested query inside another `SELECT` statement
- This allows you to take the results of one query and apply them to another query.

A subquery may occur in any of the following clauses:

- `SELECT` = Nested subquery - returns a single value only
- `FROM` = inline view
- `WHERE` = nested subquery
