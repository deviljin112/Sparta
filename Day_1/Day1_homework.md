# Presentation Homework

What I Did Well

- Simple bullet points of key areas
- Didn't read off the slides
- Looked straight at the camera (audience)
- Didn't stutter or pause but spoke fluently and concisely

What Could Be Better

- Improve on introduction (introduce team members)
- Explain the background of the presentation
- Explain what the presentation will explore

What I Will Do In The Future

- Introduce the presentation more extensively
- Close the presentation with asking the audience for questions
- Summarise the presentation
- Provide more visual stimulants in the presentation (e.g. an image)
